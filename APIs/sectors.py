"""
Description:
    This script retrieves the full Global Industry Classification Standard 
    (GICS) hierarchy from a public GitHub Gist and separates it into two structures:
      1. A simplified list of unique top-level GICS sectors
      2. A full GICS hierarchy including sector, industry group, industry, and 
      sub-industry

    Both outputs are saved as JSON files (`sectors.json`, `gics.json`) for 
    reuse in downstream portfolio allocation modeling and sector-level analytics.

    The script uses shared utility functions from `countries_api.py` for JSON 
    export and Snowflake integration scaffolding, ensuring consistency across 
    the capstone pipeline.

Functions:
    - get_gics_sectors(): Downloads and parses the GICS CSV into two structured 
    DataFrames

Output:
    - `sectors.json`: List of unique GICS sector codes and names
    - `gics.json`: Full GICS hierarchy including Sector â†’ Sub-Industry mappings

Intended Use:
    These outputs support sector allocation generation, investor reporting, and 
    metadata enrichment in synthetic VC and financial datasets. The JSON 
    outputs can be later uploaded to Snowflake's dimensional tables if desired.

Example:
    Run this script to generate GICS sector JSON artifacts:
        $ python gics_sector_extractor.py
