## ERD.dot
- This file helps visualize the different important primary and foreign keys for the tables within Snowflake. It is an easy way for anyone to quickly upload synthetic data into the database. This documentation also allows for us to build out additoinal tables easily since we can properly visualize how they will all connect back.

## institutional_data.py
 - This file works to create the institutional level data that is required. There
 is some larger organizations that contribute capital. This information was pulled
 from Pitchbook. However, there is an additional set of investors and these are
 generated randomly by using the Faker library. This is a quick and effective way
 to create a lot of fake names and other attributes.
