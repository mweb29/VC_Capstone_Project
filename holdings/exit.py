# #Exit
#
# ### Exit Generation Logic
#
# The exit event simulator creates `vc_exit_df` by **linking directly to actual holdings data** from `holdings_df` (e.g., generated via `holdings.py`).  
# It samples real companies held by each fund to simulate exits.
#
# ---
#
# ### Processing Steps
#
# | Step | Description |
# |------|-------------|
# | 1    | For each fund in `portfolio_general_info_df`, filter corresponding holdings from `holdings_df` |
# | 2    | Skip funds with no holdings (only active portfolios are eligible) |
# | 3    | Randomly select ~20% of funds to simulate exits |
# | 4    | Sample 1–5 existing companies from the fund's holdings to simulate exit events |
# | 5    | For each exited company: Assign exit type (IPO, Acquisition, Write-off), Generate exit date 3–9 years after fund close  
# | 6    | Construct one row per exit and append to `vc_exit_df` |
#
# ---
#
# ### Output Schema: `vc_exit_df`
#
# | Column | Description |
# |--------|-------------|
# | PORTFOLIOCODE | VC fund identifier (from portfolio) |
# | TICKER | Company ID (from holdings) |
# | COMPANY | Company name (from holdings) |
# | EXITTYPE | Type of exit (IPO, Acquisition, Write-off) |
# | ACQUIRERTYPE | Strategic or Financial Sponsor |
# | MOIC | Multiple on Invested Capital |
# | EXITVALUE_MILLION_USD | Exit proceeds in millions of USD |
# | EXITDATE | Exit completion date |
#
# ---

# Exit-Holdings Integration
# This updated exit event generator links directly to the holdings_df
